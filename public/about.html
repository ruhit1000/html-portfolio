<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Ruhit! I’m a quick learner who strongly believes in my ability to do my best in everything I take on. 
  Currently, I am a student with a deep interest in technology and the internet, which led me to pursue web development. 
  I find the world of coding fascinating, and it’s become my primary focus.</p>

<p>When I’m not studying, I enjoy honing my web development skills, always seeking ways to improve and learn new 
  techniques. My goal is to become a successful web developer and a full-time programmer.</p>

<p>Besides programming, traveling is another interest of mine. Exploring new places and cultures is 
  something I find refreshing and it helps me gain new perspectives on life.</p>

  <p>My journey is just beginning, and I’m excited for what the future holds. Whether it's coding 
    or traveling, I’m committed to doing my best and pushing myself to achieve my goals.</p>
